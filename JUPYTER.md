# Jupyter Notebook
> 26th September 2019

One goal of this learning repository is to understand and learn how to use
[Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
This site has all information for how to install. However, I first installed
[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) using
[these instructions for Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart)

Following this I then installed the new look interface JupyterLab:
```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

## How to use

As a die-hard-developer I will always want to use git for version control,
but at the same time it would be neat to use an online service
so others can see too. I found this article [Six easy ways to run your Jupyter Notebook in the cloud](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook/)
and am giving [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) a go.
Here you can find the
[link to the test notebooks in binder](https://hub-binder.mybinder.ovh/user/diversemix-learn-python3.7-inrcjlna/tree/jupyter)

## Test notebook

The test notebook for this learning session is [here in github](https://github.com/diversemix/learn-python3.7/blob/master/jupyter/test-notebook.ipynb).
